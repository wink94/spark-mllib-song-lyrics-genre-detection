first Ran threw alleys  parkin  lots  and took a shortcut Saw the house she ran up in And shot her fuckin  porch up Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut Looked around the room That s when I seen the bedroom door shut I know you re in there bitch  I got my gun cocked You might as well come out now She said  Come in  its unlocked I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin  gay porn She said  Come her big boy  lets get acquainted I turned around to run  twisted my ankle and sprained it She came at me at full speed  nothin  could stop her I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her I started to beg  No  please let go But she swallowed my fuckin  leg whole like an egg roll With one leg left  now I m hoppin  around crippled I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple Just trying to buy me some time  then I remembered this magic trick Den den den den den den  go go gadget dick Whipped that shit out

97664,Threshold,I get flashes of reality quickly consumed In the fog of existence and the thoughts I exhumed Are lost to the grasping fingers of understanding A dancing light on the edge of my sight That teases me through the futility of life And torments my slumbering mind into action This is not a lethal wait but it can be a kind of deception Vanity is a heavy weight fuelled by a constant rejection No rational perception of the meaning sustained I have no pain to measure but the concept remains High and illusive a briefly glimpsed bright Hall of awareness where my soul is in flight A strong evolution of humanity s ground A large inhalation of both meaning and sound Based on a primitive urge of exploration This is not a lethal wait but it can be a kind of deception Vanity is a heavy weight fuelled by a constant rejection They say that music is the window of the soul Look through the frosted pane at the melody of my heart I am the dreamer yes I am the only one I have been victim of obsession from the start She came then to me in a cloud of tension Disguised by perfume of lovers affection Maintained a silence kind of rejection Nervous of feelings she was just too scared to mention But I was staring deep into the lake of despondency Nihilistic nightmare on which I ve embarked My soul is exposed to the truth that is stark And no one can help me solving this rare conundrum But the world goes on spinning the sun comes again Washes fear from my memory clears doubt from my brain The awesome eye sweeps past into the distance This is not a lethal wait but it can be a kind of deception Vanity is a heavy weight fueled by a constant rejection,Lake of Despond,metal,1998

116261,Flip Phillips,Just friends  lovers no more Just friends  but not like before To think of what we ve been and not to kiss again Seems like pretending it isn t the ending Two friends drifting apart Two friends  but one broken heart We loved  we laughed  we cried  and suddenly love died,Just Friends,metal,1998
153412,Poison,I felt this before now I feel it again No matter how hard I try This feeling won t end So I pretend you re here by my side Tonight on this lonely ride Keep telling myself that Life goes on while you re miles away And I need you Time rolls on as night steals the day There s nothing I can do You heal up my wounds I tasted your tears You spilled out your heart So I let out my fears But one fear that I kept to myself How I prayed that you d love no one else Like you re saying you love me Life goes on while you re miles away And I need you Time rolls on as night steals the day There s nothing I can do If you only knew how much I miss you When my mind plays these tricks on me It shows me things I don t want to see That s why I tell myself now I keep telling myself now Just take another piece of me Life goes on while you re miles away And I need you Time rolls on as night steals the day There s nothing I can do Life goes on you re still miles away And I need you And this last mile I travel with you,Life Goes On,metal,1998
77850,Soviet Soviet,I d like to be  together we ll talk I d like to be  together we ll walk I d like to be  together we ll find a way I can see the force in your eyes I wanna be  together we dream I wanna be  together we swim And I wanna be  together we ll find a way I can see the force in your eyes And no excuses I ve tried to do my best Now I cannot run Follow the road into the lake I wanna be  together we fly I wanna be  together we die And I wanna be  together we ll find a way I can see the force in your eyes And no excuses I ve tried to do my best Now I cannot run Follow the road into the lake Look at that smile on her face Now I cannot stop To watch her Sleeping in my hands I feel so sorry Cause I m not so strong And you tell me I m wrong I feel so empty But I want to become So strong  so strong I want to become So strong,Rainbow,metal,1997
